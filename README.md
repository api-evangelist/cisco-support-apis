# Cisco Support APIs

<!-- API-EVANGELIST-PROVENANCE:BEGIN -->
> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **Not from the company, and here with a question?** You are welcome here — we would rather be the
> front line and point you the right way than have a good report go nowhere. What this repository
> can answer is narrow, though, so it is worth knowing who you are actually looking for:
>
> - **A question about how the API works, an account, billing, or a bug in the service** — that is
>   the company's own support, not us. We profile this API; we do not operate it and cannot see
>   your account.
> - **A bug in an open-source project we only catalog** — file it on that project's own repository.
>   This has happened with a real and correct bug report that reached us instead of the people who
>   could fix it, which helped nobody.
> - **Anything about this listing itself** — the description, the tags, the rating, a missing or
>   wrong artifact — is ours. Open an issue here.
> - **Not sure, or something general about API Evangelist or APIs.io** — open an issue on the
>   [APIs.io Inbox](https://github.com/api-search/inbox) and we will route it.
>
> **This repository contains no software, and we will never ask you to download anything.** There is
> no build, release, installer, or binary here — only text and machine-readable API descriptions, so
> there is nothing here that can be "corrupt" or need "repairing". Any issue, comment, or email
> claiming otherwise and offering a download link is not from us and is hostile. Do not follow the
> link; it is a lure. Report it to GitHub and, if you like, tell us at
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) so we can take it down.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

The Cisco Support APIs are the machine-readable side of Cisco's TAC and lifecycle operations: EoX for end-of-life milestones, Serial Number to Information for entitlement and coverage, Product Information, Software Suggestion, Bug, Case, Automated Software Distribution, and Service Order Return. They are the APIs that let an enterprise reconcile its Cisco estate against support status programmatically, and are documented on Cisco DevNet behind a Smart Net Total Care or partner entitlement.

## Ownership

Part of the Cisco family.

## Contract status

**Published, but credential-gated.** Cisco does publish a machine-readable contract for every one of
the eight Support APIs — a WADL 1.0 file per API, linked from the public
[Downloads](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/support-apis/cisco-support-apis-wadl-files/) page, plus a
Swagger YAML for Automated Software Distribution v4.0 named in that API's reference. None of them is
anonymously fetchable: every link resolves to `apiconsole.cisco.com` and returns **HTTP 403** with
"Please Sign In or Register" (probed 2026-08-19). No OpenAPI is published at any public URL.

The one first-party machine-readable artifact a member of the public can download is Cisco's own
Postman collection, [CiscoDevNet/Cisco_Support_API_Postman](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/Cisco_Support_API_Postman)
(BSD-3-Clause, last updated 2020-08-07), saved verbatim under `postman/`. It covers seven of the eight
APIs and still points at the retired `api.cisco.com` host and `cloudsso.cisco.com` token endpoint.

**API Evangelist has not authored a substitute contract.** Everything in this repository is either a
document fetched from Cisco verbatim, a probe result with its HTTP status recorded, or a derivation
from Cisco's own published reference pages. See `contracts/cisco-support-apis-published-contracts.yml`.

## What is here

| Artifact | What it records |
|---|---|
| `contracts/` | The eight published-but-403 WADL URLs and the ASD Swagger claim |
| `postman/` | Cisco's own Postman collection + environment, verbatim |
| `well-known/` | 30 probes across 6 hosts; `security.txt` and the OIDC discovery document saved verbatim |
| `authentication/` | OAuth 2.0 client-credentials profile, token endpoint, entitlement gate |
| `errors/` | 205 documented error codes across all eight APIs |
| `conventions/` | Pagination, batching, versioning and error semantics — and how inconsistent they are |
| `rate-limits/` | Enforcement is documented; the numbers are not published |
| `plans/` | No pricing, no tiers, no self-serve — access is an SNTC/PSS contract entitlement |
| `lifecycle/` | No deprecation policy, no Sunset headers, no SLA |
| `changelog/` | The published changelog page has zero entries |
| `packages/` | No first-party SDK in any language; two community Python libraries |
| `data-model/` | The identifier graph that joins the eight APIs |
| `mcp/` | No MCP server exists — a candidate tool list only, deliberately unwired |
| `conformance/` | 22 standards assessed against observed evidence |

No A2A agent card, MCP server, webhook/AsyncAPI surface, GraphQL, CLI, or agent skills were found.
